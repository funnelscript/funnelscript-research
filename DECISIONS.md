## Detailed Architecture Decision Records

### DEC-001: Core-Outwards 5-Phase Implementation Strategy
* **Status:** Accepted
* **Context:** A complete marketing programming ecosystem requires an agent cognitive model, an AST parser, a static type linter, a high-throughput runtime simulation engine, developer tooling, and visual web interfaces.
* **Decision:** Enforce a strict inside-out development sequence:
  $$\text{Agent Mind (P1)} \longrightarrow \text{AST \& Linter (P2)} \longrightarrow \text{Vectorized Runtime (P3)} \longrightarrow \text{CLI Suite (P4)} \longrightarrow \text{Web Dashboard (P5)}$$
* **Rationale:** Premature authoring of visual interfaces or surface-level syntactic wrappers masks foundational mathematical or algorithmic flaws. The core engine must be green before outward layers are constructed.
* **Consequences:** All five phases executed with 100% verification (29 Python tests green, 66M agent-days/sec throughput, Bun test green, Vite build clean).

---

### DEC-002: Hypothesis-First & Research-Gated Engineering
* **Status:** Accepted
* **Context:** AI coding agents frequently generate ungrounded code, speculative interfaces, or tautological mocks without rigorous verification.
* **Decision:** Institute an ironclad constitutional directive in `AGENTS.md`: No agent may generate, modify, or commit code without first articulating:
  1. The Research Anchor (prior art citation).
  2. The Falsifiable Hypothesis ($H$).
  3. The Mathematical Invariant (formal equation or boundary condition).
* **Rationale:** Engineering discipline demands that every code alteration is a testable experiment designed to falsify a precise hypothesis.
* **Consequences:** Code commits map 1:1 to verified scientific hypotheses ($H_{3.1}$ through $H_{5.2}$).

---

### DEC-003: Parsimonious Calibrated Micro-Foundations over LLM Personas
* **Status:** Accepted
* **Context:** Debate between instantiating $100,000$ consumers as prompt-engineered LLM personas vs. closed-form numeric vectors.
* **Decision:** Standardize agent micro-foundations on 10–15 orthogonal, mathematically bounded variables ($\alpha, \beta, \gamma, \kappa, w, s$) executed via vectorized SIMD array broadcasting (NumPy 2.x). Reserve LLMs strictly for qualitative copy analysis in offline calibration passes.
* **Rationale:** LLM-per-agent architectures suffer from parameter unidentifiability, extreme latency ($> 10\text{ hours/trial}$), non-reproducibility, and financial hallucination. Numeric micro-foundations execute at $66,000,000\text{ agent-days/second}$.
* **Consequences:** Scalable Monte Carlo simulations with guaranteed deterministic random seeds.

---

### DEC-004: Downside Catastrophe Stress-Testing over Point-Forecasts
* **Status:** Accepted
* **Context:** Marketing platforms often sell deterministic forecasting ("This funnel will make \$150k"). Real markets are open stochastic systems with aleatoric variance.
* **Decision:** FunnelScript will never output scalar deterministic predictions. All outputs are multi-trial probability distributions ($P_{10}, P_{50}, P_{90}, \text{Mean}$) accompanied by Value-at-Risk ($\text{VaR}_{95}$), Expected Shortfall ($\text{CVaR}_{95}$), and Cash Ruin Probability ($P(\text{Insolvency})$).
* **Rationale:** Capital preservation precedes profit optimization. Identifying payment clearance starvation cliffs ($\Delta_{\text{settle}}$) saves businesses from bankruptcy before deployment.
* **Consequences:** Telemetry engine explicitly models clearance lag and halts ad spend upon operational reserve depletion.

---

### DEC-005: Decoupled Statistical Calibration Contract with PyMC Marketing
* **Status:** Accepted
* **Context:** The discovery of `imMamdouhaboammar/pymc-marketing-mcp` (66 Bayesian capabilities) raised the question of whether to merge MMM and FunnelScript into a single codebase.
* **Decision:** Keep both projects completely decoupled. Interface exclusively through a versioned JSON schema: `calibration_manifest.json`.
* **Rationale:** PyMC Marketing solves the retrospective macro problem (*"What does historical data prove about channel elasticity and posterior uncertainty?"*). FunnelScript solves the prospective micro problem (*"What happens if we deploy this novel multi-step dynamic strategy tomorrow?"*). Tight coupling would compromise the agility and CI suites of both codebases.
* **Consequences:** FunnelScript consumes posterior adstock decay ($\lambda$), saturation limits ($K$), and decision gate flags (`diagnose_mmm`) directly from PyMC exports.

---

### DEC-006: Two-Tier Hybrid Agent Architecture (Population vs. Cognitive)
* **Status:** Accepted
* **Context:** Evaluating the role of `imMamdouhaboammar/OmniTwin` (Cognitive Continuity Engine with hierarchical memory, allostasis, and state reducers).
* **Decision:** Adopt a two-tier hybrid architecture:
  * **Tier 1 (Population Agents, $N = 10^5 - 10^6$):** Fast, numeric SIMD state machines for statistical significance and financial distribution metrics.
  * **Tier 2 (Cognitive Sentinel Agents, $N = 10^1 - 10^2$):** Selected focal personas equipped with hierarchical memory and state reduction (via OmniTwin adapters) to qualitatively test message framing, brand sentiment drift, and narrative resonance.
* **Rationale:** Harmonizes macro-statistical rigor with micro-qualitative plausibility without computational blowup.
* **Consequences:** Zero slowdown for the core vectorized simulation engine.

---

### DEC-007: Epistemic Decoupling: World Truth vs. Agent Belief
* **Status:** Accepted
* **Context:** OmniTwin employs a *"No ID, No Claim"* constraint to prevent AI hallucinations. In market simulation, consumers frequently hold false beliefs, miscalculate discounts, or act on unverified rumors.
* **Decision:** Decouple the Physical World State from the Agent's Epistemic Belief State:
  $$\text{AgentBelief}_i(t) \neq \text{WorldTruth}(t)$$
* **Rationale:** Forcing synthetic consumers to possess perfect information destroys the realism of human market dynamics (bounded rationality, asymmetrical information, social contagion).
* **Consequences:** Agents can transition states based on subjective, distorted valuations of products and promotions.

---

### DEC-008: The 4-Layer Stack: DSL Kernel vs. First-Party Standard Library
* **Status:** Accepted
* **Context:** Determining whether terms like `audience`, `touchpoint`, `campaign`, and `conversion` should be hardcoded compiler keywords.
* **Decision:** Formalize FunnelScript as a 4-tier stack:
  1. **Layer 01 (Language Core):** Minimal computational primitives (`entity`, `agent`, `state`, `event`, `transition`, `rule`, `probability`, `constraint`).
  2. **Layer 02 (Execution Runtime):** Discrete-event simulation scheduler.
  3. **Layer 03 (Official Standard Library):** `std::marketing` defining `Audience`, `Touchpoint`, and `Campaign` using public language primitives with zero secret compiler privileges.
  4. **Layer 04 (Community Ecosystem):** Sector-specific and regional market packages.
* **Rationale:** Establishes FunnelScript as an extensible, general programming language (analogous to SQL or Julia) rather than a rigid, single-purpose software application.
* **Consequences:** Third-party developers have first-class capabilities to create alternative domain libraries (e.g. B2B procurement models, influencer ecosystems).

---

### DEC-009: Decoupling Economic Invariants from Compiler Axioms
* **Status:** Accepted
* **Context:** Hardcoding population mass conservation ($\sum N = N_{\text{total}}$), strict zero-credit wallet limits ($P \le w$), and liquid cash halts into the compiler prevents modeling open markets, BNPL, or revolving debt facilities.
* **Decision:** Remove model-specific assumptions from the core grammar. Provide generic, expressive constraint declarations:
  ```ebnf
  ConstraintDeclaration ::= "constraint" Identifier "{" Expression "}"
  ```
* **Rationale:** The compiler checks syntax, types, and topological validity. Economic models define their own boundary invariants via explicit constraint declarations.
* **Consequences:** Full expressive versatility across diverse business structures and geographies.

---

### DEC-010: The Ontological Subtyping Principle: Agent ⊂ Entity
* **Status:** Accepted
* **Context:** Defining the primary actors and state containers of a FunnelScript program.
* **Decision:** Formalize that all Agents are Entities, but not all Entities are Agents:
  $$\text{Agent} \subset \text{Entity}$$
  * **Entity:** A passive or externally mutated state container (e.g. `Budget`, `Inventory`, `AdUnitSlot`).
  * **Agent:** An Entity possessing bounded rationality, internal decision rules, and autonomous initiation (e.g. `Consumer`, `Competitor`, `Bidder`).
* **Rationale:** Eliminates conceptual ambiguity in the language type system and simplifies runtime event dispatch.
* **Consequences:** Clear inheritance hierarchy in AST node models and runtime state management.

---

### DEC-011: The Living Intellectual Trilogy Mandate
* **Status:** Accepted
* **Context:** Engineering knowledge, architectural trade-offs, and visionary ideas are frequently lost across development sessions or isolated in transient chat logs.
* **Decision:** Mandate the continuous, simultaneous maintenance of the **Living Intellectual Trilogy** across all sessions:
  1. [`DEBATES.md`](DEBATES.md): Active philosophical conflicts, trade-offs, and dialectical synthesis.
  2. [`DECISIONS.md`](DECISIONS.md): Immutable canonical log of accepted architectural records.
  3. [`OUT_OF_THE_BOX.md`](OUT_OF_THE_BOX.md): Speculative, frontier, non-linear ideas revolving around the core vision.
* **Rationale:** Ensures durable institutional memory, complete traceability, and constant alignment between code and vision.
* **Consequences:** Enforced as a mandatory rule in `AGENTS.md`.

---

### DEC-012: FCM-001 — Event-Driven Stochastic State Machine Computational Model
* **Status:** Accepted
* **Context:** Fixed daily or step-wise tick loops cannot model intraday multi-timescale events (e.g. ad auctions at $t=10^{-3}\text{s}$, sessions at $t=10^1\text{min}$, cart recovery at $t=2\text{h}$, settlement clearing at $t=3\text{d}$) without prohibitive computational overhead.
* **Decision:** Establish Zeigler’s Discrete Event Systems Specification (DEVS) as the foundational execution model of FunnelScript:
  $$W_{t^+} = \mathcal{T}(W_t, e_t, \theta, \xi_t)$$
  * The runtime driver maintains a min-heap priority calendar $\mathcal{Q}$ of discrete events ordered by $(\tau_e, \pi_e)$.
  * Continuous background phenomena (e.g. adstock carryover, brand decay) are computed lazily via analytic step functions upon event arrival.
  * Deterministic pseudo-random seeds guarantee bit-for-bit replayability.
* **Rationale:** Eliminates millions of empty loop iterations while providing exact temporal resolution for asynchronous marketing interventions.
* **Consequences:** Vectorized cohort batching handles $10^5$ synthetic agents with microsecond event dispatch efficiency.

---

### DEC-013: FCM-002 — Dual-Mode Execution Architecture & Koka-Style Effect System
* **Status:** Accepted
* **Context:** Unifying offline simulation and live production deployment within one language without polluting simulation loops with network I/O or risking accidental live ad spend.
* **Decision:** Decouple tactical strategy logic from side-effect execution via an **Algebraic Effect System**:
  * Compiled FunnelScript rules yield pure, immutable **`EffectIntent`** values (e.g. `AdjustBudgetIntent`, `DispatchMessageIntent`, `HaltSpendIntent`).
  * Effects are executed exclusively by interchangeable, pluggable handlers:
    1. `SimulatedEffectHandler`: Updates in-memory vector arrays with zero network I/O.
    2. `ShadowEffectHandler`: Passively monitors real webhook traffic without emitting external mutations.
    3. `LiveEffectHandler`: Validates safety ceilings, computes HMAC signatures, and calls external provider APIs (Meta, Klaviyo, Shopify).
* **Rationale:** Pure strategies remain 100% testable and side-effect free in simulation, while the identical compiled AST can be safely deployed to live production.
* **Consequences:** The compiler never links against HTTP clients or API credentials; all side-effects are sandboxed at runtime.

---

### DEC-014: Shadow Execution Mode for Risk-Free Live Observation
* **Status:** Accepted
* **Context:** Deploying an algorithmic marketing strategy directly to live execution carries severe financial risk if synthetic consumer assumptions diverge from real consumer behavior.
* **Decision:** Introduce a first-class **Shadow Execution Mode**:
  * The runtime ingests real-world event webhooks from live platforms (Shopify orders, Meta spend reports, Stripe webhooks).
  * The strategy state machine evaluates rules in real time, recording all intended actions and computing predicted metrics.
  * Outbound network mutations are intercepted and suppressed; divergence metrics ($\Delta_{\text{actual vs predicted}}$) are logged to telemetry.
* **Rationale:** Provides an empirical burn-in observation period to validate strategy behavior and detect modeling drift before committing real marketing capital.
* **Consequences:** Establishes a zero-risk bridge between offline simulation and live capital deployment.

---

### DEC-015: Idempotency Keys and Compensating Actions for Irreversible Live Operations
* **Status:** Accepted
* **Context:** Unlike relational databases where transactions can be rolled back via `ROLLBACK`, external marketing actions (sent emails, SMS messages, published ad sets) cannot be un-executed. Network retries can also trigger duplicate billing.
* **Decision:**
  * Mandate deterministic SHA-256 idempotency keys for all live mutations:
    $$\text{Key} = \text{SHA256}(\text{strategy\_id} \parallel \text{event\_id} \parallel \tau_e)$$
  * Require explicit **Compensating Actions** (Saga pattern) for irreversible side effects when a campaign is paused, canceled, or fails mid-execution (e.g. deactivating a leaked discount code or dispatching correction notifications).
* **Rationale:** Guarantees at-most-once execution semantics and predictable failure recovery across distributed third-party marketing APIs.
* **Consequences:** `LiveEffectHandler` verifies idempotency state before dispatching any provider API mutation.
